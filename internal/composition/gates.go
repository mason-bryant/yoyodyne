package composition

// The gates the ledger's Exercised sentences refer to. Each one is here rather
// than inline in a test because what it holds is a claim about this repository
// that somebody may want to run over another set of files — and because a gate
// written as a test body is one no fixture ever proves works.
//
// None of them is deep. A shell file that parses can still be wrong and a
// workflow with a job and a step can still do the wrong thing. What they buy is
// that a change made entirely of shell, YAML, or JSON cannot reach a reviewer
// with nothing having read it, which is the state yoyodyne-ifd.156 was
// integrated in.
