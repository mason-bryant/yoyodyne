// ChangedGoPackagesVariable is the environment variable every check is given,

// per-run gate narrowed to them reads it — `go test -race
// $YOYODYNE_CHANGED_GO_PACKAGES` — and a check that does not is unaffected by
// it being there.
//
// It is an environment variable rather than a substitution into the command,
// because a check is a line of shell the operator wrote and the shell already
// has a way to say "what the harness told me": the line reads as itself in the
// configuration, the narrowing is visible in it, and a check that never
// mentions the variable runs exactly as it always has.

// NarrowGoPackages works out which Go packages a change touches, from the

//
// A changed file belongs to the nearest directory above it that holds Go
// source, which is how the Go command itself files a package's test data and
// embedded files under the package: a file under `pkg/testdata/` is `pkg`'s. A
// file above every package — a document, the Makefile, a workflow — belongs to
// none, and is left to the checks that run whole; what this narrows is the suite
// the operator chose to narrow, and the rest of the gate still runs over
// everything. The module files are the exception, because a dependency change
// reaches every package: a change to `go.mod` or `go.sum` is the whole module.
//
// It reads the tree rather than running the Go command, because it is asked on
// the way to building one stage's environment and a `go list` over the module
// would cost more than the narrowing saves on a small change. What it cannot
// see is a package that depends on a touched one — that is what the landing
// check over the whole module is for.
