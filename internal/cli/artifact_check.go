// The gate for the governed documents, run by whoever owns one.
//
// The rest of the artifact commands report what is wrong and exit zero, which is
// the right thing for a listing: an unapproved document, a broken relationship,
// and a revision crossing the ownership boundary are all things that stop
// nothing, and a command that refused over one would be a command nobody could
// use to look. This one exits non-zero on any of them, and that is the whole
// difference: it is the check an owner runs after editing, and the place a
// governed-document defect fails.
//
// It exists because the failing used to happen somewhere nobody could act. The
// repository-coupled gates in `make test` read these same documents, and a
// malformed one turned every developer's run red over a file every developer's
// diff refuses — so the only route out was an amendment proposal made while
// every run stayed red. Those gates escalate now (internal/governeddoc), which
// leaves this as the place the defect still fails loudly, run by the one person
// who can put it right. The index at the door of every artifact home names it.
