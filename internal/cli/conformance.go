// Checking the system against what it records about itself, before a version is
// tagged.
//
// `make check` says the code does what its tests say. This says the repository
// still means what its documents say: that every canonical artifact is one, that
// every reference between them and every link in the prose reaches something,
// that every architectural invariant is one a run would actually be delivered,
// and that every admitted work item traces to a goal the product states. Tagging
// then means the system demonstrably matches its recorded intent rather than
// only that its tests pass.
//
// The sequence is not written here. It is a workflow definition — this build
// ships one and a project may keep its own — validated and compiled before a
// single check runs, and walked by the workflow runtime one durable transition
// at a time. What this file does is find the definition, read what the checks
// judge, and render the answer for the two readers it has: an operator at a
// terminal, and the release notes the passing result ships in.

Check this product against what it records about itself, which is what a release
is tagged behind. Every canonical artifact is one, every reference between them
and every link in the documentation resolves, every architectural invariant is
one a run would be delivered, and every admitted work item traces to a goal the
product states. What a change upstream left unanswered downstream is reported
too, and refuses nothing -- staleness is a condition to look at rather than a
broken build.

It writes nothing. A divergence exits 1 and names every mismatch the check that
found it collected, which is what refuses a tag in `+"`make release`"+`.

The sequence is a workflow definition rather than code. This build ships one;
a project that wants its own copies it to
.yoyodyne/workflows/release-readiness.yaml and edits it there. Either way it is
validated and compiled before a single check runs, and the result says which of
the two it ran.

Options:
  --config <path>     configuration file (default: the nearest .yoyodyne/config.yaml)
  --workflow <path>   workflow definition to run (default: the project's own copy, or the built-in one)
  --json              emit machine-readable JSON
  --notes             render the result as the Markdown section a release's notes carry`)
