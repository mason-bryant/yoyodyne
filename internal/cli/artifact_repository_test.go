// The tests here read this repository's own artifacts rather than a fixture,
// because a fixture cannot fail the way that matters.
//
// Every artifact test in the package below builds a synthetic store in a
// temporary directory, and every document in one satisfies whatever the loader
// currently requires, because the test wrote it that way. The documents that are
// actually governed — the brief, the goals, the non-goals, and the decision
// records — were written before any given rule and are the ones a tightened
// loader silently drops. A document that stops loading does not fail loudly: it
// leaves the set, and what referred to it is reported as naming something nobody
// wrote.
//
// What each finding does about it is decided the same way the goals gate beside
// this one decides it. Whether the artifacts could be read at all is about the
// reader, which is a developer's to fix, so it fails here. What a successful
// read reported about one document — a `supports` entry naming nothing, an
// artifact reaching no brief, a revision recorded by a role that does not own
// the file — is about a document in an artifact home, which every developer's
// diff refuses, so it is escalated to its owner and fails `yoyo artifact check`
// instead. internal/governeddoc says why.
