// Where the wakeup a refused tracker block earns meets the role's own
// conversation.
//
// It is wired into the pull for the reason the recurring schedule and the
// stopped-work delivery are: the wakeup is a conversation turn, the pull is where
// the harness is already deciding what to do next, and the harness is the only
// thing that invokes a role. A separate daemon, a cron entry, or a launchd job
// would each be a second invoker of one.

// Wake puts the correction message into the conversation whose block was refused,

//
// It addresses the agent rather than only the role, because a refusal belongs to
// one conversation: a project with two agents on one role has two of them, and
// waking the other would hand the refusal to a conversation that never sent the
// block.
//
// A conversation that could not be opened is reported as unreachable rather than
// as a failed wakeup, and the difference is what the caller records: nothing was
// asked, so the refusal is exactly where it was. The ordinary reasons opening
// fails — the operator is mid-turn with the role, the provider is not signed in,
// no agent fills the role — are all of that kind.
//
// A woken turn whose own block is refused is not a failed turn either. The role
// answered, and what it answered with was refused a second time — which is the
// ending that goes to the operator, and is already recorded against the
// conversation by the refusal machinery itself. It is carried back so the pass can
// say so rather than reporting a turn that failed.
