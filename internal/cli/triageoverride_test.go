// The sequence a cap-exhausted item actually goes through, driven end to end:
// the development manager's decision refused by a cap, the escalation that
// refusal is evidence for, the operator crossing the cap with the terminal
// command, and the same decision asked for again and recorded.
//
// It is here rather than in either package it spans because it is the whole
// path or it is nothing. The conversation refuses against the durable counters,
// `yoyo triage override` writes to the same counters through the real command,
// and the resubmission reads them back — and every previous version of this
// promise was true of one of those three and false of the sequence.
