// The tests here read this repository's own goals rather than a fixture,
// because the fixtures cannot fail the way that matters.
//
// Everything the goals gate does rests on one document parsing: the heading
// whose whole text is `Goals`, each goal an unindented entry under it, and an
// attribution matching a statement word for word once case, spacing, and
// trailing punctuation are folded. A document that stops satisfying any of that
// does not fail loudly — it yields no goals, `Known()` goes false, and every
// attribution becomes "uncheckable", which stops admission being refused and
// reports the queue as unchecked rather than untraceable. Synthetic documents
// written by a test satisfy the parser by construction and can never catch it.
//
// What reading them here may fail over is the harness's own record and not their
// prose, which is yoyodyne-ifd.326's decision and the same line
// internal/goal/goal_test.go now draws. A goal written across two lines, a goals
// document that states none, and a repository with no goal in force are things a
// person wrote in a document they own, and a `make test` that goes red on one of
// them makes rewording the document to suit the checker the cheapest way out.
// They are reported instead, by `yoyo goals list` on stderr and in `--json`, and
// carried into a release assessment by internal/conformance's goals check —
// where a goals document nobody can read and a repository with nothing to check
// an attribution against refuse the cut, and a wrapped goal is a note beside it.
// That is a surface that can afford to be right about them: it reads them in
// front of the person who owns the document, at the moment it matters.
//
// So what fails here is what this repository's own code got wrong about those
// documents — a report naming no place to open, a goal the harness collected and
// then cannot resolve, and an attribution the tracker already carries that no
// longer names anything.
