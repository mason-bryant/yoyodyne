package readmodel

// A claim with nothing behind it, which is the other state nothing in the record
// announces.
//
// The silence reading beside this one asks whether anything at all has started.
// It catches a line that has stopped over a queue with work in it, and it
// structurally cannot catch this one: an item the harness claimed has left the
// ready queue, so a machine whose only startable work is sitting under dead
// claims reads as a drained queue from every surface here — nothing held,
// nothing running, nothing ready, nothing wrong. That is what happened on four
// nights of the week of 2026-09-01, twice in one hour on the last of them, and
// each time the line was idle until somebody looked in the morning.
//
// So this reads the claims against the runs. Not "what does the tracker say is
// being worked on" but "does the harness actually have a run alive for it" — a
// question answered from the runs' own records rather than from the claim, which
// is why it survives the death of the process that made the claim. The claim is
// the one thing a dead run leaves behind that nothing else cleans up: the run's
// record stops moving and the item stays claimed forever.
//
// What is here is only the reading. Giving the claim back is the harness's, and
// saying so is the surface's, exactly as the silence reading beside it divides
// the same work.

// tracker catching up.
//
// Half an hour is chosen against what it costs to be wrong in each direction, and
// the two costs are not symmetric. Acting early releases an item something is
// still finishing, which the scheduler then declines to start anyway — a run in
// flight for an item is what keeps it out of every pull — so the price is a
// message nobody needed. Acting late is the failure this exists to end, and the
// window that was actually paid for was a night at a time. It is the same half
// hour DefaultStallThreshold takes, deliberately: an operator reading both
// messages should not have to hold two different ideas of how long is too long.
