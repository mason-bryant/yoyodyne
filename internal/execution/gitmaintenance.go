// Git's automatic maintenance, fenced out of every process the harness starts.
//
// Maintenance prunes worktree registrations, and it judges one stale by whether
// its administrative files are there -- which is exactly what a `git worktree
// add` has not written yet while it is still filling the entry in. A prune
// reaching that window deletes the registration out from under the add, which
// fails with "could not open .git/worktrees/<id>/locked for writing", and the
// run is lost to nothing but timing. It reproduces on git 2.50.1 within seconds
// of putting a prune beside concurrent adds.
//
// The harness already refuses to ask for maintenance in the Git commands it
// composes itself, by passing the two settings as `-c` options. That fences one
// caller and no others: every worktree the harness cuts shares the repository's
// common Git directory, so a Git command an agent runs, or one a project's own
// build tooling runs inside a worktree, hands the same repository to the same
// prune. Those commands are not the harness's to compose.
//
// What the harness does control is the environment it launches them in, and Git
// reads configuration from the environment as well as from files: GIT_CONFIG_COUNT
// with a GIT_CONFIG_KEY_n and GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_n for each setting applies to the
// command that reads it and to everything it goes on to spawn. So the fence is
// injected there, once, and every descendant of a harness-launched process
// carries it without knowing it did.
//
// It is deliberately not written into the managed repository's config. That
// repository belongs to whoever is developing in it, its maintenance is theirs
// to configure, and object GC turned off in a repository that keeps growing is
// a cost the harness would be imposing on someone else's machine for good. The
// environment fence lasts exactly as long as the process it was given to.
//
// What it does not reach is a Git command nobody here launched -- a person's own
// `git gc` in the checkout, or a tool they started themselves. That residual is
// the operator's, and `docs/operations.md` says so rather than leaving it to be
// rediscovered by a lost run.

// The environment variables Git reads configuration from. The count names how
// many of the numbered pairs are real; a pair past it is ignored, which is why
// the count is written last and always rewritten.

// written after it: Git applies these in order, so the fence is the last word on
// these two settings and says nothing about any other. The numbered pairs are
// rewritten from scratch rather than appended to, which is what makes applying
// this twice the same as applying it once -- a harness process launched by a
// harness process is an ordinary arrangement, and a fence that grew a pair per
// generation would be one nobody could read.
