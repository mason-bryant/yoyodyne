// Package landing carries a developer's claim about what its change does to the
// work item, as distinct from what it does to the repository.
//
// The two are not the same fact and the harness cannot derive one from the
// other. A change that integrates has landed something; whether what it landed
// is the work the item asked for is a judgement about content, and closure used
// to follow integration alone. That produced the defect this exists for: a run
// answered an item it could not do yet by landing a diagnosis that said in bold
// that the work had not been done and the item stayed open, the diagnosis
// integrated, and the item closed against it — retiring a marker the operator's
// accepted trade depended on, on evidence that said the opposite.
//
// So the developer says which kind of landing this is, and closure follows the
// claim rather than the integration. An honest "not doable yet" is valuable
// evidence and lands exactly as any other change does; what it does not do is
// discharge the item. A reply that claims nothing claims the ordinary landing,
// because nearly every run is one and a protocol that made every developer
// declare the obvious would be a protocol nobody read.
//
// A third outcome is not a landing at all. An item that cannot be met as it
// stands has nothing worth integrating and nobody in the run who can decide what
// happens to it, so the claim ends the run where it was raised and routes the
// item to the development manager instead. It is here rather than in a channel
// of its own because it answers the same question the other two do — what
// becomes of the work item — and because the reviewer has the same verb, so the
// two roles say one thing one way.

const Contract = `# What your landing does to the work item

Two different things can be true when your change lands. Usually the work item is discharged by it: what you changed is the work the item asked for, and the item closes. Sometimes it is not — the work turns out not to be doable yet, and what there is to land is the evidence for that: a diagnosis, the conditions that have to hold first, the reason the item is still open. Both are worth landing, and only the first closes the item.

Your change cannot say which of the two it is, so you say. A reply carrying no block below claims the first, which is nearly every run.

To claim the second, put exactly one block of this shape in your reply, ahead of any other block it carries:

` + "```" + `yoyodyne-landing
{"outcome":"evidence","why":"what you landed instead, and what has to happen before the item can be discharged"}
` + "```" + `

"discharged" is the ordinary landing. "evidence" is a landing worth keeping that does not discharge the item: your change integrates exactly as it would have, nothing is written down as done that was not, and the item is parked with your account of the claim as its parking reason. Parking keeps the item in the product manager's order and says why it is not to be started, so nothing selects it again until somebody releases it. Write the "why" accordingly: name what would release the item, because that sentence is what whoever considers releasing it reads.

Where you can name the impediment as another work item, say so and the item is left open waiting on that item instead of parked:

` + "```" + `yoyodyne-landing
{"outcome":"evidence","why":"what you landed instead, and what has to happen before the item can be discharged","blocked_by":"the-work-item-that-has-to-land-first"}
` + "```" + `

That is the only alternative to the parking, and it is deliberate: an item put back with nothing marking it is one the harness picks again straight away, for another run and another diagnosis of the same impediment. Name a work item that exists and is unfinished — you cannot open one, and finished work holds nothing back. The harness checks the tracker for it and takes the parking where the answer is anything else, so a marker you guessed at costs nothing and buys nothing. If there is no such item, leave the marker out, take the parking, and name the work that has to be admitted in your summary.

The reviewer is shown which landing you claimed, so a diagnosis is judged as a diagnosis rather than as a missing implementation. It is shown the default too, on a reply that claims nothing: a diagnosis offered with no block is one the reviewer is told will close the item, and what it does instead is approve the change as evidence, which keeps the change and leaves the item open on the reviewer's account of it rather than yours. So a landing you meant to be evidence and did not claim is settled by somebody who did not do the work, in words you did not write, rather than closing the item quietly.

Claim "evidence" for work you found is not doable yet and landed the evidence for, not for work you simply did not finish. Something that stopped you is a failure, and you report it the way your role already reports one.

There is a third outcome, for the item that cannot be met at all as it stands — the acceptance criteria contradict a ruling, ask for something no change here can produce, or describe work that has to be replanned before anybody can do it:

` + "```" + `yoyodyne-landing
{"outcome":"escalate","why":"what makes the item unmeetable as written, and what you would need decided"}
` + "```" + `

"escalate" ends the run where you raised it and puts the item in front of the development manager as a decision — replan, park, resequence, or redirect — with your account as the whole of what she reads about it. Nothing is integrated, and the item is parked until she decides, so it is not picked up again in the meantime. Raise it as soon as you are sure rather than after attempting the work anyway: the point of the verb is that saying so costs one round instead of a run, and it takes no "blocked_by" — an impediment you can name as a work item is the evidence landing above, and this is the answer for when nothing in the backlog is what the item is waiting on.

Escalating is not how you report being unable to finish. It is a claim about the item rather than about your run: the work as specified cannot be done by anybody, not that this attempt did not manage it. Something that stopped you is a failure, and you report it the way your role already reports one.`
