package runstate

// The lease, taken on something that is not a run.
//
// Runs, promotions, and the account rotation each take their lease through the
// store that owns them, because what may hold one is decided there. Other
// harness state has the same need and no such store: the Slack sink owns one
// thread map per product, and
// two sinks against it would open two threads per work item and post everything
// twice. That is the same problem an unheld run is, so it is solved the same
// way rather than with a second mechanism — an advisory file lock the operating
// system drops when its holder exits, so a killed process leaves nothing for
// anybody to clear.

// TryLeasePath takes the exclusive lease on one path without waiting, reporting
// whether it got it. A lease that is already held belongs to a live process, so
// the caller is told so rather than queued behind it: what these leases guard is
// ownership of something singular, and waiting for it would mean two owners
// taking turns rather than one owner.
//
// The label names what is owned, so a failure to take or release the lease says
// which. The file outlives the lease for the reason a run's does: removing it
// while another process holds it would let a third take a lock on a file nobody
// else can see.
