// A durable record outlives the binary that wrote it, and this binary is rebuilt
// many times a day. A landing that adds one field to a record therefore leaves
// every process still on the previous build reading records whose shape it has
// never seen — and refusing those records is what wedged three long-lived
// readers in three days: the dashboard thirty-one hours stale on
// work_item_labels, the Slack sink twenty hours on the same field, and the sink
// again on stale_block_clear, that last one retrying the identical pass a
// hundred and nineteen times with its cursors where they were.
//
// So a durable record in this package is read through one of two doors, and
// which door a caller goes through says what the caller is about to do rather
// than how careful it feels like being:
//
//   - A read that only says what a record holds reads tolerantly: a listing, and
//     a surface that fetches one record by id to show it — Store.Read,
//     ConversationStore.Read, ExchangeStore.Read, and the records nothing ever
//     reads to write back, the supervisor's and the watch holder's. It keeps
//     every field this build knows, steps over the fields it does not, and says
//     once for the life of the process — rather than once per pass — which
//     fields it stepped over. What makes that safe here and nowhere else is that
//     nothing decided from such a read is written back: every caller that acts
//     on one re-reads the record through the strict door first, under the
//     record's own lease, because what it read is a snapshot another process may
//     already have moved on from.
//   - Everything that precedes a write reads strictly. A field this build does
//     not know means the record was written by different code, and decoding it as
//     though the field were not there and then saving it back is exactly how the
//     field is lost. That refusal is an error the caller reports on its own
//     surface; it is never an empty answer. So does a gate that declines to
//     proceed on a record it can only read part of — a hold, a pausing directive
//     — whose refusal is the visible failure it is owed.
//
// decodeStrictly is the second door and decodeTolerating is the first.
// strictdecode_audit_test.go lists every strict read in the tree and which of
// those it is, and fails on one it does not list.

// decodeStrictly decodes one durable record, refusing a record that carries
// anything this build does not know and a record with more than one value in it.

// decodeTolerating decodes one durable record, keeping the fields this build
// knows and naming the ones it does not. Everything a strict decode would refuse
// for some other reason it refuses too: a tolerated field is the one thing this
// steps over.
//
// The strict decode comes first and is nearly always the whole of it, because a
// record this build wrote carries nothing this build does not know. Only a
// record that has something extra in it is read a second time, so a listing over
// records of this build's own shape costs exactly what it cost before. The
