package runstate

// One workflow instance's position in the graph it is running.
//
// A run record says what the harness is doing to a work item — the worktree, the
// branch, the publication, the verdicts. This says where a compiled workflow
// instance stands: which definition it is pinned to, which state it is in, and
// every boundary it has crossed to get there. They are apart because they are
// facts about different things, and they are in the same store for the reason
// every other record here is: the harness has one durable state root, and a
// record that lives anywhere else is a record a second writer has to keep safe.
//
// The record is the position rather than a copy of one held in memory. An
// executor reloads it before every transition and writes it before beginning the
// next, so a process that dies leaves behind the answer to where its successor
// starts — and that answer is a state boundary, never the middle of an action.
//
// It is pinned to a digest from creation to terminal, which is the whole of what
// "in-flight work is never silently migrated" amounts to: the definition file may
// be edited, replaced, or deleted, and this record still names the one thing this
// instance is running.
//
// What is checked here is the shape a record may hold, held to this package's
// own patterns rather than to the workflow package's constants, for the reason
// the run record is: the durable schema stays independent of the code that
// produces what it stores, so a record is checked against what a record may hold
// rather than against what this version of the harness happens to write.

// taken then, and the checkpoint eventually recorded carries a later one: a
// width that moves with the clock makes "the widest boundary this step could
