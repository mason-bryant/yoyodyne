// A run that exited on its in-process usage-limit bound, and the sweep that
// continued it.
//
// A run waiting out a provider's refusal sleeps its probes inside one process
// until that process has spent execution.usage_limit_in_process_pause on it,
// and then exits with the run still in flight and its deadline recorded. Until
// yoyodyne-ifd.428.5 the only thing that continued such a run was somebody
// typing `yoyo run` on its item, and a run nobody typed it for had the shape
// of the phantom 428.4 settled for a provider stopped on time: no live process,
// no ending, a developer slot held, and the in-flight guard refusing every item
// beside it — indefinitely, because unlike the stopped provider nothing about
// it was wrong. The reconcile sweep now continues one itself once its recorded
// deadline has passed and nothing holds its lease, in the same worktree and
// developer session `yoyo run` would use, and this is what the run's record
// says about that.
