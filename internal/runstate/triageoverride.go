// Crossing one work item's triage caps: the operator's own override, and the
// bounded crossing the development manager takes himself.
//
// The caps beside this exist to stop machines looping, and they do it by
// refusing: a development manager past an item's round budget may escalate or
// re-scope, and may not hand the item back again. That is the whole of what they
// are for and it is right — until the escalation is answered, at which point they
// refuse the answer as well. An item at five rounds of four could have no re-run
// recorded against it, the re-run verb refuses without that record, and the
// escalation entry records neither, so an operator who read the escalation and
// decided the work should be run again had no recorded path to say so. The
// decision was carried out by admitting fresh work in its place, twice, which is
// surgery rather than a path.
//
// So a cap is crossable. An override is the decision written down: the budget it
// lifts, what it lifts it to, who decided and when, and why. An unbounded raise
// and a cleared budget are the operator's own hand and stay there, recorded by a
// terminal command for the reason `yoyo release` is one — the switch that answers
// an escalation has to work with no conversation open.
//
// One narrow crossing is not the operator's any more, and this is where that is
// enforced. Every override recorded in the week to 2026-09-06 was granted, most
// of them within minutes of the escalation that asked for it, under the
// operator's own standing direction: the operator step was latency rather than
// judgement. So the development manager may cross a cap on his own recorded
// authority, by one, up to MaxDelegatedCapCrossings times per item, and only with
// a justification recorded on the item and reported to the operator as it
// happens. That is a veto by reading rather than a permission to ask for: the
// crossing is in force the moment it is recorded, and what keeps it answerable is
// that the operator sees it at once and can undo the work it bought.
//
// The bound is the whole of the delegation. A sixth crossing of one item is
// refused naming the operator's command as the path, a crossing carrying no
// reason is refused outright, and neither clearing a budget nor raising one by
// more than a single step is his at all. CrossedBy is what tells the two apart on
// the record, so an item's overrides say who gave it each piece of room.
//
// It clears or raises, and never lowers. An override that would leave a budget no
// larger than it already stands is refused, so an item's overrides are a
// monotonic account of who gave it more room and why, and the last word on a
// budget is also the largest. Lowering a cap is a judgement about a project's
// pace rather than a decision about one item, and `triage.review_rounds_cap` is
// where that is made.
//
// It lives on the item's own counter record rather than beside it, because the
// guards read the counters under that record's lock and must not have to reach a
// second store — and because an override read from somewhere else could be read
// at a different moment from the counters it crosses.
