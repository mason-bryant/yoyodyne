// Why the harness is running this work item.
//
// While the operator started every run themselves, the answer was never worth
// recording: they typed the identifier, so they knew. Once a development manager
// pulls from the queue and work starts without anybody asking for it item by
// item, the answer stops being obvious and starts being the thing that separates
// autonomy from work happening behind somebody's back. A run nobody can account
// for looks the same whether it was chosen well or chosen by a bug.
//
// So it is recorded with the run rather than derived afterwards. It is written
// once, when the run is reserved, by the process that holds the run's lease, and
// nothing changes it: what made the harness pick this item is a fact about a
// moment, and a later reading of the queue is a different fact.
//
// It is absent from a run recorded before selections existed, and absence is
// reported as "no reason recorded" rather than rendered as a blank — an
// unaccounted run is exactly what this exists to make visible, so it must not be
// possible to mistake one for a run whose reason happened to be empty.

// from the backlog the way a development manager does, but it is the harness
// choosing by the order and the readiness the tracker already holds rather than
// an agent weighing anything, and a record attributing its choice to a role that
// never ran would be evidence of something that did not happen.

// not evidence that the choice was unaccounted for, and must not be recorded as
// though it were.
