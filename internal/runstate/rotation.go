// The account rotation, held together across the two steps it is made of.
//
// The pool's cursor is the run records: a start is served by the first active
// alias after the one the last run recorded, and the record that moves the
// cursor is the one that start reserves. Those are two steps, and with nothing
// holding them together two starts in the same moment read the same cursor and
// are both served by the same account — the pool double-serving under exactly
// the concurrency it exists for. The lease below spans the read and the write,
// so a start that has chosen has already moved the cursor the next one reads.
//
// It is a sibling of the promotion lease and works the same way: an advisory
// file lock the operating system drops when its holder exits, so a start whose
// process died leaves no stale lock for anybody to clear. Like a promotion and
// unlike a run, it is waited out rather than refused — two starts choosing
// accounts are not a duplicate of one another, they are two runs entitled to
// begin one after the other.
//
// It is per product, because the records the cursor is read from are.
