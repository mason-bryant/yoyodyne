package gitworktree

// Clearing what a killed `git worktree add` leaves behind.
//
// An add registers its entry under the common Git directory's worktrees/ and
// then fills it in one file at a time: a locked file saying "initializing"
// first, then gitdir, commondir and HEAD, then the checkout that writes the
// index, and last of all it removes the lock. A process killed anywhere along
// that line leaves the entry as it stood, and nothing Git has clears it. `git
// worktree prune` skips an entry that is locked and judges an unlocked one by
// its gitdir file, which such an entry usually has; `git worktree remove` and
// `git worktree unlock` find the entry through the listing, which is what the
// entry breaks. So the entry stays, and where the file it was killed writing
// was commondir, every command that walks the registrations — every listing,
// every creation, a rebase checking that a branch is not checked out elsewhere
// — fails over it from then on: one killed add stops every later run on the
// repository until a person removes a directory by hand.
//
// What clears it is here, and it runs where nothing can still be writing the
// entry. The harness's own adds hold the registry lease from before `git
// worktree add` until the new checkout is verified, so under that lease an
// entry that is not finished is not one of ours in flight. An add somebody else
// is running holds no lease, so an entry is also left alone while it is young
// enough to be one of those still working — see unfinishedRegistrationGrace.
// Only the registration is removed: the branch the add created is a branch
// like any other, and a directory the add left on disk is the same thing to
// this package as any directory Git is not managing, which it never touches.
