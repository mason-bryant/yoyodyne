// what a harness-run Git command is launched with is what that program is
// launched with. Reading the environment out of a hook is the only way to see
// that from the outside, which is why this test writes one rather than
// inspecting the Command the manager composed.
//
// post-checkout is the hook `git worktree add` runs, and the add is deliberately
// one of the Git commands the harness does not disable hooks for: a worktree
// whose creation skipped the repository's own checkout hooks is not the worktree
// the project's tooling expects.
