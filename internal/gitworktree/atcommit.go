// FileAtCommit reads one repository-relative path as the named commit holds it,

// reviewer judges a change against: a file the change is measured against has to
// be the copy at the change's own base, because the primary checkout has moved on
// by the time a review is asked for whenever anything else was promoted meanwhile,
// and a correct change read against a later revision reads as a divergent one.
//
// A committed tree has no link to follow out of the repository, so the read is
// confined without a filesystem check; a symlink entry is refused rather than
// read, because its blob is the link's target path and not a document.
//
// The content comes back through the line-oriented process runner, so it is held
// to the size the tree entry states: a blob the runner could not return whole —
// a line past its bound, a carriage return it folded — is an error rather than a
// document that is quietly not the file.
