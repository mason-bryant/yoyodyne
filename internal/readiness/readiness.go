// Package readiness reads what a work item says it needs, and checks each of
// those needs against the tree as it stands — before the item is dispatched
// rather than by the run that spends itself discovering it.
//
// Four items in a fortnight cost a full developer run each to establish
// something a read would have said in milliseconds, and they are one class
// rather than four accidents:
//
//   - yoyodyne-ifd.284 asked for the coherence scan "shipping after the DM
//     hourly sweep and inheriting its machinery". The machinery was whole and
//     reviewer-approved on yoyodyne-ifd.283's unmerged branch, so nothing the
//     item needed compiled on the base its run was cut from.
//   - yoyodyne-ifd.209.14 asked for a conversion whose subject — ifd.142's
//     coordination slice — is on a branch too. Its own text says it is "not
//     decomposable further until the runtime exists and the management-conversion
//     design lands", and it was pulled into a run twice regardless.
//   - yoyodyne-ifd.100.1 states "blocked until the architect's answer exists".
//     The answer came, and it negated every one of the item's done conditions;
//     two runs delivered empty trees before a third wrote the ruling down.
//   - yoyodyne-ifd.291 was admitted citing domain.Backend.SupportsRole, deleted
//     weeks earlier by f07a6ba, for a gap yoyodyne-ifd.97 had already closed.
//
// So this asks two questions of an item, and each is a read.
//
//   - Does the tree still hold what the item points at? An item that pinpoints
//     a `file:line` or a qualified symbol is pointing at code somebody read, and
//     a pinpoint naming code that is no longer there is the cheapest possible
//     already-satisfied signal. It is exact, and it clears by itself: the item
//     becomes pullable the moment the code it names is in the tree.
//   - Does the item say of itself that something has to happen first? Sequencing
//     stated in prose is invisible to everything that pulls — the tracker knows
//     about dependency links and not about a sentence — so an item that says it
//     is gated is one the queue reads as ready forever. What clears this is a
//     person: the product manager amending the item, or the development manager
//     recording the dependency the sentence names.
//
// Nothing here refuses anything, and nothing here is enforcement. It reports
// what one item's own statement asks of the tree, and the caller decides. That
// is deliberate: a readiness reading that could stop work would be a second
// account of what may be pulled, beside the tracker's dependency graph and the
// holds, and two accounts of one rule are two answers an operator has to
// adjudicate.
//
// # What it reads, and what it deliberately does not
//
// It reads the four fields somebody authored — title, description, design
// guidance, acceptance criteria — and never the notes. The notes are where the
// harness appends each run's record and where a development manager writes the
// implementation plan, so they are full of paths and symbols that are the work's
// output rather than its prerequisites. That is measured rather than assumed:
// over the 435 items this repository's tracker held when this was written,
// reading pinpoints out of the notes as well fires on 20 of the 76 unfinished
// items, nearly every one of them a file the item exists to create. Reading the
// authored fields alone fires on 6 items in 435 and on none of the unfinished
// ones, and every one of the 6 is a rename somebody really made. A guard that
// fires on a quarter of the queue is one whoever reads it learns to read past.
//
// A bare path is not a pinpoint for the same reason. An item that names
// `docs/configuration/agents.md` is as likely to be asking for the file as
// citing it, and the three documentation-split items in this backlog are exactly
// that shape. A line number and a qualified symbol are not ambiguous in that
// way: both mean somebody read what is there.
