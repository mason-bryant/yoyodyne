package exchange

// The advisory half of the management loop: what the harness reads before it
// takes a round, and what it reads again after a restart.
//
// Three things are derived here and nothing else is. They are the whole of what
// this file is for, and each of them is a property of the durable record rather
// than of any process that happens to be running.
//
// A restart loses nothing and repeats nothing. A round is on disk before the
// answering provider is invoked, so a process that dies mid-round leaves a round
// that was asked and never answered — which a later pass can tell from a round
// that came back, and from a round somebody is taking right now. The first is
// reclaimed, the second is left alone, and the third belongs to whoever holds
// the lease.
//
// Coordination is bounded. One exchange takes its rounds one at a time, which is
// the lease; across the product the number of exchanges with a round open at
// once is capped, which is the bound below. Neither is enforced here — Survey
// says which exchanges may be carried now and which are queued behind the bound,
// and the harness is what carries them.
//
// Judgments go stale visibly. An exchange records the durable things it was
// asked against and the revision each was at, so a question put against
// something that has since moved is derivable rather than remembered. What that
// produces is a reason to tell the asking role, and nothing else.
//
// # Advisory rather than authoritative
//
// Nothing here invokes a role, and nothing here stops one. Survey reads records
// and returns what the harness may do now; the harness is what invokes, under
// its own lease and its own gates, because it is the only thing that may — the
// harness-is-the-only-role-invoker invariant is why this returns a plan rather
// than taking one. A stale exchange in that plan blocks nothing either: it names
// the asker to tell and what moved underneath it, and what happens next is that
// role's decision or the operator's.
