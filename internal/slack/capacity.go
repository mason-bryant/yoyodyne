// The provider holding every role, said again while it stands and louder as it
// ages.
//
// The stall beside this reports a line stopped for reasons the record cannot
// name, and the window reports a session waiting out a limit it met itself.
// Neither said anything between 2026-09-08 and 09-13. The session choosing work
// was idle over items waiting on a decision, so it recorded no window; the role
// that would have decided was refused twenty times a day, and every refusal was
// said once in the channel as itself. Nothing said the thing they added up to:
// every role held, on a reset five days off, with nothing configured to move
// the work elsewhere. The operator heard about it from his assistant.
//
// This is the capacity half of that alarm, and it is shaped the opposite way
// from the window on purpose. A window is the provider's ordinary behaviour and
// is said once, as a note, in the channel. A hold over every role is the
// harness stopped by something a person can change — enabling failover on the
// agents is what would have moved the work — so it goes to the operators
// directly the first time it is seen, is said again in the channel every
// heartbeat it stands, and once it has stood long enough that no timer ends it
// it is said as critical and taken to them directly again with each repetition.
// The reading is the read model's; what this decides is only that it is worth
// somebody's phone, and how often.
