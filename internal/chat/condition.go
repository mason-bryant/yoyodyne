// A done-condition no developer run may satisfy is refused where the item is
// written.
//
// Every door into the queue that carries an item's text asks the same question
// of it: does a clause of what done means name a path under one of the
// artifact homes, or a document one of those homes owns, without a grant for
// it? Three items in one week were admitted with one — a design's query list
// to mark, a design's status entry to reconcile, a ruling to record on a design
// — and each cost a run before the reviewer or the developer found the clause
// the run could not meet. The check belongs at admission, where refusing it
// costs the role a sentence and the correction is the one the reviewer would
// have named anyway: take the clause out and say the document's owner amends
// it, or carry the grant where the change behind it is already decided.
//
// The question is asked with the item's executor beside it, because the same
// clause is right on an item a conversation carries and unmeetable on one a run
// does — and because the shape of conversation work is read whether or not a
// document is named. yoyodyne-ifd.330 was admitted as "The architect designs
// side conversations" with "Done means the design is recorded in the governed
// documents" and no executor, named no document, and was handed to a developer
// run that could only report the design had already landed. An item that reads
// so and names no executor is refused with the marker as the fix.
//
// The run asks the same question of the item it is handed, before it claims it
// (orchestrator.refuseUngrantedCondition), because two of the four fields a
// grant and a condition are read from are written with the tracker's own
// command rather than through any door here, and because the queue predates
// this gate.
