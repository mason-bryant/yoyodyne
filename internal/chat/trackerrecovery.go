// A conversation's writes carry every decision the roles make — a triage
// decision, an admission, a note, a closure — and until yoyodyne-ifd.366 not one
// of them was retried. yoyodyne-ifd.264 put the operator's rule, that the harness
// never fails outright on anything that can recover, around the run pipeline's
// boundaries and nowhere else; the path that lost yoyodyne-ifd.142's re-run
// recording, a `bd update` that timed out under the development manager's
// conversation, was left with the honest report yoyodyne-ifd.327 added as its
// only mitigation.
//
// So every call a conversation makes to the tracker goes through the wrapper
// below, which is the pipeline's rule with the pipeline's numbers: a failure
// whose class internal/recovery recognizes is waited out on the same Fibonacci
// backoff, under the same cap and the same window, and asked again. Only a call
// that has spent the window is reported the way it always was — with the
// attempts and the time in front of it, and then with the settling yoyodyne-ifd.327
// added, which is exactly the order the item asked for: the timed-out write is
// reported per 327 only after the retries are spent.
//
// A creation is the exception to asking again blindly, because it is the one
// write whose repetition is a second thing rather than the same thing twice: see
// Create below.
//
// It is wrapped once, where the session opens, rather than at each of the thirty
// call sites, so no call site can opt out and no later one can forget. And every
// wait is recorded on the conversation's log before it is taken, for the reason a
// run records its own: a turn that took two minutes because the store was
// contended must not read as a turn that took two minutes thinking.
