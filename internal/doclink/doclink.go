// Package doclink is the links a repository's documentation makes to itself,
// resolved rather than believed.
//
// The artifact layer already reports a reference that names nothing: a
// `supports` entry pointing at an id no document answers to is a broken
// relationship, and it is reported beside the set rather than left to be read
// out of prose. That covers the links documents make in their frontmatter and
// nothing else. The links a reader actually follows are written in the prose —
// `[the product brief](../brief.md)`, `[design invariant
// 1](../../designs/v1-harness-design.md#design-invariants)` — and until now
// nothing resolved one.
//
// Nobody can. A relative path is checkable by eye only by holding the directory
// layout in your head, and a `#fragment` is worse: it names a heading in another
// file, through a slug nobody writes down, so a reviewer looking at a patch can
// see the link and cannot see the target. That is what the reviews of this
// repository kept saying — "the anchor slug could not be verified from the
// evidence available", "a grep for those two anchors across the repo would
// confirm it before merge" — and a check that a reviewer has to end by asking
// somebody else to run is attention spent on nothing.
//
// So both ends are resolved here. A relative target has to be a file that is
// there, and a fragment has to be a heading the target document carries. What is
// deliberately not resolved is anything outside the repository: an absolute URL
// is somebody else's to keep working, and reaching for one would make the check
// depend on the network.
//
// Source files are read for the same fragments, because prose is not the only
// thing that cites a heading. `internal/config/scaffold.go` writes
// `docs/configuration.md#checks` into every `.yoyodyne/config.yaml` `yoyo init`
// has ever generated, and a workflow definition names an anchor in a comment.
// Those are the citations that cost most when they die — a generated
// configuration is on a disk this repository cannot rewrite — and they were the
// ones nothing here resolved, so a documentation split that moved a heading
// could pass every check and break them. yoyodyne-ifd.121 moved twenty-two
// README sections at once, which is the size of that exposure.
