// The rules that keep an item out of a scheduling pass are stated in more than
// one guide, and the copies drift. On 2026-09-04 the configuration guide named
// seven where the work guide named nine, and the two it had lost were parking —
// the rule added after a draining queue started deferred work and spent $34.38 —
// and the conversation executor. An operator reading only the configuration
// guide could not learn that parking exists. So each guide carries the list
// between two markers, and this holds the lists to the same names in the same
// order.
