// Package artifacthome answers, at the door of every directory of documents the
// harness governs, the question a newcomer asks there first: what is filed here,
// whose is it, and may I edit one by hand.
//
// The answers already exist and are scattered across the configuration guide,
// the design document, and the harness's own code. What did not exist was
// anything that put them where somebody standing in the directory would meet
// them, so the first thing an operator did with `docs/decisions` was guess. Three
// sentences at the door cost nothing and are the whole of what this package
// writes.
//
// It writes prose rather than governed documents, and that is what makes the
// prose safe to write at all: a `README.md` in an artifact home is exempt from
// artifact identity by name (internal/artifact's indexFileName), because an index
// describes what is filed beside it rather than stating any intent of its own. So
// nothing here creates an artifact, claims an id, or records a revision — every
// one of which would be a mutation only an owning role may make.
//
// Nothing here decides policy either. The hand-edit answer these files state is
// the one the harness already enforces: a non-owner proposes an amendment rather
// than editing, an operator's own edit is reported rather than refused, and what
// a change leaves stale downstream is reported by `yoyo stale`. A README that
// invented a rule would be a fourth place for the rule to disagree with itself.
