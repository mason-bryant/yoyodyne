// What a conversation did to the backlog, read from the log it wrote while
// doing it.
//
// Runs are the first producer of reportable events; conversations are the
// second, and they arrive the way the design said a producer would — a selection
// function here, and nothing whatever in the sink, the threading, or the
// envelope. The shape is the same as a run's: a durable record written by a
// process that is long gone, read afterwards by something that decides nothing
// about it.
//
// What is worth saying about a conversation is not what was said in it. Most of
// a conversation's log is the turn itself — the provider's messages, the tools
// it asked for, the reply as it was written — and none of that is a milestone.
// What is a milestone is the queue moving: work admitted, work decomposed, a
// goal recorded on an item, an item's place in the order changed, and what the
// operator decided about work an agent proposed. Those are the harness's
// steering wheel turning, and an operator who cannot see them is watching a
// factory whose direction changes silently.

//
// The rest of the vocabulary is deliberately absent. Reading an item and
// surveying the queue change nothing; a note, a link, and a reparenting are the
// structure around work rather than the work arriving or moving; and closing an
// item is already said by the run that finished it. A channel that reported
// every tracker call would be the event log this exists not to be.
//
// The exception is work no run carries, and it is the reason two of these are
// named at all. An item marked for a conversation is never selected, so there is
// no run to say any of it: the note the architect writes on it is the only sign
// the work started, and the close is the only sign it finished. For that item the
// rule above inverts — the actions that are silent everywhere else are the whole
// of its narrative, and without them its thread ends on a failed run and says
// nothing for the rest of the item's life.
//
// The inversion is exactly that narrow. It covers the two actions that are a role
// doing the work, and it does not touch the ones that are the queue being kept
// around the work: an item marked for a conversation still gets attributed to a
// goal and still gets reordered, those are still what they always were, and
