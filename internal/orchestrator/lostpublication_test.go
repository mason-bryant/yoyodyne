// The shapes yoyodyne-ifd.402 was admitted on, replayed, and the rule it
// established: a promotion whose record holds no pull request is an outstanding
// publication every surface reports, never a run that finished quietly.
//
// docs/diagnoses/yoyodyne-ifd-402-publication-record-not-lost.md is the account
// of the two runs. Neither record lost its request; what each shows is here so
// the reading stays checkable — a queued merge is on the record the run
// completes with and settles on the next sweep, and an escalated run's request
// is on its record and, now, on the docket entry the development manager reads.
