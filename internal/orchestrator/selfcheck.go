// would hand that developer back a refusal for evidence it had recorded, on top
// of the withheld closure it already has.

// An unreadable block is recorded as a problem rather than swallowed, for the
// reason an unreadable landing claim is: the developer that wrote one was trying

// nothing" are different facts to whoever reads this afterwards. Both fail the
