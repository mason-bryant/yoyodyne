// What a run's provider invocations spend, attributed as each of them is made.
//
// The money itself comes from the provider and the classification from the
// meter; what this file supplies is the half neither of them can know — which
// work the invocation served, which configured agent made it, and on whose
// account. All of it is read from the run's own durable state rather than from
// the configuration in force right now, so a run resumed by a later process
// charges its spend to the account and the configuration it was set up under
// rather than to whatever the file says today.
