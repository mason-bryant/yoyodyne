// A provider refusal met outside a run, written down where the sink reads it.
//
// A run parks: the limit, the deadline, and the item that is waiting all go into
// the run's own durable state, and the record it leaves is what an operator who
// was asleep reads in the morning. Everything else the harness points at a
// provider has no run to park. A branch review is the one here — it has no run
// store, no worktree, and no integration by design — so an exhausted limit
// stopped it at somebody's terminal and left the product's record saying
// nothing.
//
// This is the other half of that. It is not a pause: nothing here waits, retries,
// or spends a budget, because the caller is an operator who asked for a review
// and is owed the refusal now. What it does is leave the trace.
