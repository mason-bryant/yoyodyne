// A run is attributable to the account that served it.
//
// The pieces of this are tested where they live — the pool's rotation and
// budgets in internal/config, the spend and the cursor in internal/runstate, the
// environment on the command in internal/backend/claudecode — and none of that
// says the wiring holds. What makes a run attributable is that one account is
// chosen once, written onto the record, and then read back off that record by
// every invocation the run goes on to make: the first developer attempt, each
// repair, and the review of the change. A pipeline that chose again per
// invocation would pass every one of those other tests and still split one piece
// of work across two subscriptions.
