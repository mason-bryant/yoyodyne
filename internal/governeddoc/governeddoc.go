// Package governeddoc decides where a defect in a governed document surfaces.
//
// The repository-coupled gates read this project's own brief, goals, designs,
// decision records, and invariants, and fail when one of them is malformed.
// That is worth having: the class they catch — a goal hard-wrapped across two
// physical lines, a `supports` entry naming a document nobody wrote — is
// mechanical, invisible to a reader, and has occurred. What it cost is the other
// half of the same arrangement. Those documents live in the artifact homes, and
// every one of those homes is refused in a developer's diff
// (internal/protectedpath), so one malformed document turned every developer
// run red over a defect no developer could fix, with the only route out an
// amendment proposal made while every run stayed red.
//
// So a defect is routed rather than merely reported. What decides the route is
// where the document lives: a defect in a directory the harness protects is the
// owning role's, and one anywhere else belongs to the change in hand. The first
// is escalated — named in full, with the role that owns it and the way to reach
// them, and failing nothing — and the second still fails, because it is a defect
// the change in hand can put right.
//
// The ownership is read from the artifact homes rather than restated here, for
// the reason every other reading of that table is: a project that files its
// designs somewhere else has moved the home rather than changed whose it is, and
// a second copy of the table is a second answer to who owns a document.
//
// One thing is given up deliberately, and it is worth naming rather than
// discovering. A loader tightened until a governed document stops parsing is
// reported by that loader as the document being malformed, and would be
// escalated here as the owner's. What keeps that class a failure is the gates
// asking it as its own question — whether the governed documents could be read
// at all, which is about the reader and not about any one document — and passing
// through here only what a successful read reported beside the set it produced.
