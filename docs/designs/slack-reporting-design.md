# Slack reporting: events out, directives in, one thread per topic

## Status

This design serves epic yoyodyne-ifd.68 and is the deliverable of yoyodyne-ifd.68.1. Its implementation children are yoyodyne-ifd.68.2 (notifier and voice), yoyodyne-ifd.68.3 (sink, manifest, setup), and yoyodyne-ifd.68.4 (two-way steering, deferred in implementation and first-class here). Each child names below the sections it builds.

## What this is for

Work the harness runs on its own is acceptable only while it is visible, and today visibility means a terminal an operator is sitting at. This design puts the same account of the work into a Slack workspace: one message per reportable event, in the reporting persona's own voice, one thread per topic, and — when yoyodyne-ifd.68.4 lands — a thread reply reaching the persona as a durable directive. It serves the autonomy goal (visibility is what makes unattended work tolerable, and thread replies are the override clause reaching a new channel), the legibility goal (one thread per topic is boundaries between topics; one voice per speaker is boundaries between speakers), and, for the inbound half, the directives goal verbatim: durable, discoverable, and enforceable regardless of which agent received them.

## Design decisions

**1. The source is the durable record, never the running process.** Runs, conversations, and branch reviews already persist normalized event streams that `yoyo-status` follows, and reportable milestones are already read from durable run state by the conversation's activity lines. The notifier reads exactly those records. Rejected: in-process hooks calling Slack from orchestration code. The recorded event is the account a person reading afterwards would get, so posting from it means Slack says what the record says; and a reporting channel wired into the run's critical path is one whose outage can touch a run, which the next decision forbids.

**2. The sink is one separate, long-running process.** A single operator-started process (verb to be settled at implementation; I propose `yoyo slack`) holds the Socket Mode connection, tails the durable streams from per-stream cursors, owns the thread map, and posts. Rejected: posting from each run process. Runs are ephemeral and concurrent; N processes posting means N racing writers to one thread map and a token in every run's environment. With one sink, the credential boundary is structural rather than behavioral: **no run process, and therefore no agent's subprocess tree, ever has a Slack token in its environment at all.** The harness posts; agents cannot, and not because they were asked nicely.

**3. Reporting is observation, never a gate.** Slack being down, slow, or misconfigured changes nothing about any run: no wait, no failure, no park. The sink catches up from its cursors when it returns, so messages arrive late rather than never. At-least-once delivery is accepted: a crash between a post and its cursor advance may duplicate a message, and a rare duplicate is chosen over a lost one because the durable record, not Slack, is authoritative.

**4. Socket Mode, confirmed.** The harness runs on operators' machines behind NAT; the Events API would demand a public HTTPS endpoint per operator, which fails the near-one-click setup requirement outright. And Socket Mode is bidirectional on one connection, which is what makes 68.4 a feature flag rather than a transport redesign: the websocket that posts is the websocket replies arrive on. Rejected: incoming webhooks — outbound-only, so two-way would mean a second transport later, which is precisely the rework this design exists to prevent.

**5. Persona voice is deterministic; agent-authored text is verbatim.** Two kinds of outbound message, and the split is load-bearing:

- **Harness facts** — a run starting, checks passing, a verdict, a promotion — are rendered from the event by per-role voice templates shipped alongside the personas (68.2's deliverable), with each persona given its own Slack display name and avatar on the message. No provider invocation per event. Rejected: voicing events through a model. It prices visibility at a model call per event, makes the channel nondeterministic, and puts a model between a fact and its reporting — a model paraphrasing "checks failed" is a model that can misstate it.
- **Agent-authored text** — a report, a proposal's summary, an ask-exchange turn — is posted as the agent wrote it, attributed to its persona, already redacted (decision 7). This is where the genuine voice lives, at no added cost and no added risk: it is text the agent already said, in a channel that already carries agent text to operators.

**6. One vocabulary, two directions.** Outbound events and inbound directives are two halves of one contract, correlated by topic (section: *Addressing*). The inbound half creates **no new directive machinery**: a thread reply is a new *receiver* for the existing directive record — same kinds, same pause semantics, same resolution — so nothing about the channel can weaken directive governance, because the channel does not have its own governance to weaken.

**7. Nothing unredacted can reach Slack, by construction.** Events are redacted before persistence (the design's existing security rule), and the sink reads only persisted records. A message body over Slack's size limit is truncated with a marker naming the durable record that holds the whole; nothing is ever split into a flood of messages to fit.

## The outbound vocabulary

Every outbound message is one envelope:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `kind` | What happened — the reportable event types below. |
| `topic` | The thread key: `work-item:<beads-id>`, `exchange:<id>`, or `product` (section: *Addressing*). |
| `speaker` | The role and configured agent whose account this is, or `harness` for what no persona did. |
| `severity` | `critical`, `warning`, `note` — the reports vocabulary, and rendered so critical cannot be mistaken for a note; the words carry the meaning, decoration only adds to it. |
| `body` | The rendered or verbatim text. |
| `refs` | Correlation ids: run, conversation or exchange, work item, directive, pull request. |

The initial reportable set is deliberately the milestones the conversation's activity line already reports, plus what has no terminal surface at night: run claimed and started — **carrying the recorded selection reason**, so the fact the `selected-work-passes-intake-and-records-why` invariant makes durable is also the fact an operator sees; checks passed or failed; the reviewer's verdict; promotion; publication, queued merge, and merge; a run parking (usage limit, overload, operator pause, unresolved directive) and continuing; a blocker recorded; a report filed, at its severity; a proposal raised; an ask-exchange turn, and an exchange closing — including closing unresolved at its round cap, which escalates to the operator and is exactly the kind of message this channel exists to carry. Each transition is said once; a thread is a narrative, not an event log scrolling sideways.

The set is versioned in the envelope and extensible: a new producer adds kinds without the sink, the threading, or the inbound half changing. The **notifier interface (68.2) takes `(topic, speaker, event)` and assumes nothing about the producer** — runs are the first producer, conversations and branch reviews are the same shape, and ifd.99's ask exchanges are a recorded second consumer arriving later with `exchange:` topics and per-exchange cost beside its rounds.

## Addressing: one thread per topic

The primary topic is the work item: the first event for `work-item:<id>` opens its thread in the configured channel with a header message naming the item, and every later event for that topic is a reply in it. An ask exchange that concerns a work item posts into that item's thread, because the epic's rule is one thread per *topic* and the item is the topic; an exchange with no item gets its own thread. Product-level events with no topic — pause placed and lifted, intake held and released — post to the channel top level, unthreaded, because they are about the whole line and burying them in any one item's thread would misfile them.

The topic-to-`thread_ts` map is durable at the state root, per product, owned by the sink alone, so a restart posts into the same threads. **Known limit, stated rather than solved:** the map is per machine, so two collaborators' harnesses against one shared repository would open two threads per item. That is team-mode coordination and belongs to yoyodyne-ifd.82.2; this design keeps to one sink per product per workspace and says so in its setup documentation.

## The inbound vocabulary (built by 68.4; designed now)

A message in a topic's thread maps onto the existing directive surface and nothing else:

- A plain reply records an **operational directive**, scoped to the thread's work item, `received-by` the persona it @-mentions or the product manager by default.
- The pausing kinds are **stated, never inferred**, exactly as the CLI requires: a reply opening `ambiguous:` or `artifact: <name>` records that kind, and must state what is unresolved or be refused — the same rule, because a pause nobody can name a reason for is a pause nobody can lift, and a classifier guessing which sentences pause work is the failure the CLI already refused.
- `resolve <directive-id> <how>` resolves, with the existing unique-prefix rule.

Every inbound message gets an in-thread acknowledgment that is itself an outbound event: the directive as recorded with its id, or the refusal with its reason. A directive recorded from a thread is indistinguishable, downstream, from one recorded by `yoyo directive` — same record, same pause gate, same discoverability — which is what "enforceable regardless of which agent received it" costs and all it costs.

**Authorization is allow-listed and defaults closed.** Inbound messages act only when their Slack user id is in the configured operator list; the list lives in `.yoyodyne` because user ids are identity, not secrets. An unlisted user's reply is acknowledged as not acted on — visibly, because a channel that silently ignores some people looks broken rather than closed. The default list is empty, so shipping 68.4 changes nothing for any workspace until an operator names themselves. Rejected for now: operator *commands* (`/stop`, `/hold`) from Slack — directives move intent and commands move the machine, and widening the machine's control surface to a chat workspace is a separate decision; the inbound transport already exists, so adding it later needs no redesign, which is the standard this design is held to.

## Configuration and credentials

- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` in the sink's environment only. Never in `.yoyodyne`, never in Beads, never in any prompt or context bundle — and structurally never in a run process (decision 2).
- In `.yoyodyne`: the Slack section — enabled flag, channel, the operator allow-list — validated like everything else, with a project that enables Slack but lacks a channel refused at load, before anything runs.
- The checked-in app manifest (68.3) declares the least scopes the design needs: posting, per-message display-identity override, Socket Mode connectivity, and reading thread replies in the configured channel. Setup is: create the app from the manifest, install, export two tokens, start the sink. The setup document is held to the readme's newcomer standard.

## What each child builds

- **68.2** — the envelope, the notifier interface `(topic, speaker, event)`, the reportable-event selection from the durable streams, the voice templates and display identities, severity rendering. Sections: *decisions 1, 5*, *outbound vocabulary*.
- **68.3** — the sink process, Socket Mode connection, cursors and catch-up, the thread map, the manifest and setup docs. Sections: *decisions 2, 3, 4, 7*, *addressing*, *configuration*.
- **68.4** — the inbound mapping, authorization, acknowledgments, wired to the existing directive record. Section: *inbound vocabulary*. Its precondition is the epic's, not a technical one: one-way has proven itself in production threads.

## Invariants and existing constraints

`one-promotion-per-target-branch` is untouched: this design performs no Git operation and no promotion. `selected-work-passes-intake-and-records-why` binds nothing here — this design schedules nothing and claims nothing — but the run-started message deliberately surfaces the selection reason that invariant makes durable. No agent acquires a credential or a new capability anywhere in this design; every post and every directive recording is the harness's own act.
