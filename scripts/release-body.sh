# release-body.sh - compose one release page's body: the notes this repository
# carries for the tag, with the install preamble under them.
#
#   bash scripts/release-body.sh v0.3.1 /tmp/body.md
#
# This is the release workflow's own step, extracted so it is a thing that can
# be run and tested rather than eight lines of YAML whose first execution is a
# tag push against a real published release. .github/workflows/release.yml calls
# it and passes the result to `gh release create --notes-file`, as the whole of
# the body: the forge's own generated changelog is never appended to it.
#
# The composition is deliberate in two places. The tag's notes go first and the
# preamble under them, because what changed is what a returning reader came for
# and installing is what a new one came for, and only one of those two can be at
# the top. And the notes file's own `# <tag>` heading is dropped, because the
# release page is already titled with the tag and the same words twice reads
# like a mistake.
#
# A tag with no notes file publishes the preamble alone rather than failing. A
# release with thin notes is worth more than a pushed tag with no release behind
# it, and the tags cut before the notes home existed are exactly the ones that
# would otherwise turn a rerun of this workflow into a red build.
#
# The body is the whole of what the release page carries as text, and the forge
# refuses a body over a fixed length: 125,000 characters at GitHub, which
# v0.5.0's tag push met as `HTTP 422: Validation Failed: body is too long`. That
# body was these notes with the forge's own generated changelog under them,
# which the workflow no longer asks for; what is left is the curated notes, and
# they grow with the backlog. So the composed body is measured. At a fraction
# of the limit it is warned about on stderr, where the workflow's log shows it,
# so the notes are shortened before the release they would refuse; over the
# limit it is refused here, naming the length, rather than handed to the forge
# to refuse with less said. Both figures are read from the environment --
# RELEASE_BODY_LIMIT and RELEASE_BODY_WARN_PERCENT -- so the suite can exercise
# them against notes a few hundred bytes long.
#
# Requires bash. Nothing in the repository is written: the only thing written is
# the destination the caller named.
