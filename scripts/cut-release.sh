# cut-release.sh - cut one release: gate on its notes, on the system matching
# what it records about itself, on the adoption walkthrough and on the checks,
# build the archives and their checksums for the tag, then tag the commit they
# were built from -- which is the commit origin's default branch already holds.
#
#   make release VERSION=v0.3.0      what an operator runs
#   scripts/cut-release.sh v0.3.0    the same thing, without make
#
# This is a verb rather than a checklist because the cadence is daily. A
# checklist is a list of things somebody can skip on the day they are in a
# hurry, and the day somebody is in a hurry is exactly the day the walkthrough
# would have caught something. One invocation runs the gate every time, and a
# red gate refuses the cut and names what was red.
#
# What it does not do is publish. The tag push is the irreversible half and it
# is what .github/workflows/release.yml acts on, so it stays a separate act the
# operator takes deliberately; this prints the one command. Everything before
# that point is what this makes certain.
#
# A cut writes nothing to the default branch. On 2026-09-20 the v0.5.0 cut
# passed every gate, committed its own housekeeping on main -- the readiness
# result stamped into the notes, and the tracker's derived exports -- and
# tagged that commit; the push it printed was refused, because main requires a
# pull request, and a pull request produces a different commit, so the tag
# named a tree main would never hold, and a second cut had fresh housekeeping
# it could not push either. So the tag names the commit origin's default branch
# holds when the gates pass, which is what the gates ran on; the tracker's
# derived exports are excluded from the tree check and left where they lie,
# since nothing a release ships is built from them; and the readiness result
# reaches the notes the way every other change reaches the default branch,
# through a pull request ahead of the tag. Whether the branch is protected is
# asked before anything is built, and answered with which step it changes.
#
# The order is deliberate: every gate runs before anything is written, and the
# tag is created last, so a refusal at any point leaves the checkout exactly
# as it was. Two refusals leave something behind, each of them ahead of the
# walkthrough and the cross-compile, and each says outright what it wrote. A
# release whose notes are missing has them drafted -- a cut with no story to
# tell writes docs/releases/<tag>.md from the work items that landed and
# refuses, so the tag lands on a commit that carries its own notes. And a
# release whose notes do not carry a current readiness result has it committed
# on a branch, `release/<tag>-readiness-<commit>`, pushed, and a pull request
# opened for it where the forge's command line is installed; the cut after
# that merge finds the result on the default branch and goes through.
#
# Requires git 1.9 or newer, for the `:(exclude)` pathspec the cleanliness
# check uses. Also make, go, python3 -- which compares and stamps the readiness
# result here as well as rendering the draft in scripts/release-notes.sh --
# and bd, which the release-readiness gate reads the work items through; the
# notes read them from the tracker's export instead. gh, the forge's command
# line, is optional: with it the cut asks whether the default branch is
# protected and opens the readiness pull request itself; without it, both are
# named as unchecked and the branch is named to open one from. Nothing outside
# the repository is written except that branch and its pull request, and the
# tag is never pushed.
