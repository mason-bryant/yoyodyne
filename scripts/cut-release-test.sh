#
# The verb's whole value is that it refuses, so the refusals are what needs
# testing, and testing them against this repository would mean a real
# walkthrough and a real cross-compile for each one. What cut-release.sh needs
# is a git repository with a walkthrough, a notes writer, and a Makefile beside
# it, so each case builds one: a scratch repository holding a copy of the
# script, a stub walkthrough that is green or red on request, a stub notes
# writer, a stub forge command line that answers whether the default branch is
# protected and records the pull request it was asked to open, and a stub
# Makefile whose `check` and `dist-verify` targets do the same. Everything the
# script does to a repository -- reading it, drafting a release's notes into
# it, committing a readiness result on a branch of it, tagging it -- then
# happens to the scratch one.
#
# The real scripts/release-notes.sh is stubbed rather than copied, because what
# cut-release.sh is gated on is a file being there and a writer that can say it
# failed; what that writer puts in the file is
# scripts/release-notes-test.sh's claim.
#
# A protected default branch is a bare repository with a receive hook that
# refuses every push to main, the way a forge's protection does, unless the
# forge itself is merging a pull request -- which this stands in for by
# touching a file the hook looks for. The loop the verb is built around is
# driven through it: a cut that commits the readiness result on a branch and
# stops, the merge, and the cut that tags what main then holds, through to the
# tag push the verb prints, executed against that same remote.
#
# Everything lives under one temporary root that is removed on exit. No tag is
# written anywhere but there, and nothing is pushed anywhere but there.
#
# Requires bash, git, make, and python3.
